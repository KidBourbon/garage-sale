# Yard Sale Website
The project started as part of the course "Curso Práctico de Frontend Developer" of the company Platzi. At the beginning it was made only with HTML and CSS. Then during the course "Curso Práctico de JavaScript" JavaScript was added, allowing the page to be dynamic.
The website represents a yard sale of a variety of products classified according to their category. Of these we also have: the name, the price, a description and an image. The website is fully responsive and adapts to any screen size of any device larger than 320px.
